## Botarena
The BotArena is a regular competition between fully automated Screeps AIs. It is the ultimate test of your Screeps code. There is no luck with being online at the right time, your bot has to make every decision by itself with the sole exception of where the initial spawn goes.

All players with a fully automated AI are invited to participate.

Rules are subject to change, stay up to date in #botarena in the screeps slack.

### Rules:

*during spawn in ticks will be paused and you can choose any available room on a first come first serve basis

*you can respawn into a different available room at any point up until server lockdown

*server will be locked down after approximately 20K ticks (one safe mode) after tick start

*server lockdown will prevent all code changes, code upload, console commands, and gui access to functions such as placing flags

*do not program your bot to respond to target specific players or respond in a particular way to a player

*do not program your bot with any prior knowledge of which rooms it should take for extensions or expansions, it should make these decisions based on its exploration of the game world

*do not use another players Screeps AI unless it is drastically different from the base version with your own modifications (no NCPs)

*use the initial safemode period to only fix bugs in code and not to guide your bot to victory for use cases in that specific round
