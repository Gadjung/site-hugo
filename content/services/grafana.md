### How does it work?
So you may be wondering, "Why would I trust my Screeps login to someone else?" 
Great news! You don't have to, ScreepsPlus uses an agent based approach, 
a small program runs on your PC, a Pi, or whatever. That agent connects to
screeps.com and downloads your stats, it then sends those stats here for the graphing software.
