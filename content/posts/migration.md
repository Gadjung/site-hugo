I'm currently working on migrating the service to a new server cluster, in the
meantime, registrations are disabled. Once migrations are complete I will
reenable new account registration.

If you need your token for the agent, contact me on slack with your S+ username
and email (if set) and I will lookup the token for you.

Thanks for your patience, I hope to have all this resolved soon.
